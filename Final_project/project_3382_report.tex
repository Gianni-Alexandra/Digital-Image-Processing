% To make our document nice we want a header and number the pages in the footer.

\newcommand{\Title}{Project Report}

\pagestyle{fancy} % With this command we can customize the header style.

\fancyhf{} % This makes sure we do not have other information in our header or footer.

\fancyhead[l]{\footnotesize \Title}
%\lhead{\footnotesize Lab1 Report}% \lhead puts text in the top left corner. \footnotesize sets our font to a smaller size.

%\rhead works just like \lhead (you can also use \chead)
\fancyhead[r]{\footnotesize Digital Image Processing}
%\rhead{\footnotesize ECE327 - Ψηφιακά Συστήματα VLSI} %<---- Fill in your lastnames.

% Similar commands work for the footer (\lfoot, \cfoot and \rfoot).
% We want to put our page number in the center.

\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0.4pt} % Line at the footer visible
